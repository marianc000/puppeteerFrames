  <textarea id="textArea">Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

        Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
        Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
        Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
        Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
        Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
        Test Chrome Extensions.</textarea>
